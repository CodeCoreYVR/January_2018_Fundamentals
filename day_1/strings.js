'this is a string'
"this is also a string"
`this is yet another way to define a string (ES6+)`

// the line below is a string although it's a number, the resulting object will
// be treated as a string
'1'

// in the line below we escaped the ' character by putting \ before it
'he said it\'s raining outside'

// single quotes and double quotes are the same, functionally speaking

// backticks enables us to do string interpolation which is putting a piece of
// code within our string
`Hello ${5 * 6}`

// with backticks we can put variables or a small piece code within ${}
